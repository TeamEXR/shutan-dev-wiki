# Chapter 1: Numbers for everything

The magic that enables computers to do so many different tasks nowadays isn't because they are somehow sentient or because there's a magical matter inside every PC or mobile that can do everything.

It's because we humans are very good at turning everything into numbers

On a fundamental level, all computers see and work with are numbers, either numerical properties of data, or data turned to numbers using made up tools. Examples include describing colors by dividing them into Red/Green/Blue and assigning a number between 0 and 255 to them. Or assigning a number to every letter on a keyboard then putting numbers together to form text. 

These numbers aren't meaningful by themselves, but they become meaningful because we assign them meanings. This makes them a **Code**. The rules that we use to assign meaning to numbers is called **Encoding** (or **Format**). The Process of converting data into numbers is called **Coding**. The process of converting numbers back to their original form is called **Decoding**.

**Machine Code** (numbers that machines are designed to work with) lets us harness the power of electricity to make our tasks easier and faster. All we need to do is to encode problems into math operations, design electric processors that can run those math operations really fast, and design devices that convert data to numbers and back (called **Input/Output** devices).

An example is using a **Scanner** to scan a picture on a paper:

1. The Scanner (an input device), scans the picture and encodes it as numbers
2. The numbers are sent to the processor
3. The Processor asks the Monitor (an output device) what image it's currently displaying, and compares the numbers representing the scanned image and the currently displayed image, manipulating them using math operations.
4. The new numbers (now representing the scanned image in a way the monitor can work with) are sent to the Monitor
5. The Monitor decodes the numbers and displays the scanned image.

You could take the processor away, grab the numbers from both the monitor and the scanner, then do all the caculations needed to Encode the image as numbers the monitor understands. But it would take a couple of hours. A processor can finish all that in less than a milisecond thanks to the power of electricity.

Since every program and data in a computer consists of machine code we can easily view, we can analyze the numbers and extrapolate the inner workings of said programs/data. For example we can analyze Pokemon X/Y by looking at the numbers it consists of, and then edit those numbers to modify the game itself.

But first we have to understand how Computers work with numbers, and for that we need to understand how electrical Calculators work. Let's start by building a calculator.
