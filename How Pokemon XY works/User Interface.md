# GUI

The GUI of gen 6 pokemon games is based on NintendoWare4CTR's built-in framework (nw:lyt1). The GUI assets are stored as a number of .bclyt/.bclan/.bclim files which are in turn stored inside LayoutPack (DARC) files.

[TODO: make a list of all known GUI assets in XY and where they're located]
