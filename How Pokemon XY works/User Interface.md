# GUI

The GUI of gen 6 pokemon games is based on NintendoWare4CTR's built-in framework (nw:lyt1). 

The GUI archives (.arc/DARC) are stored inside simple wrapper files called Layout Data Archives (.lytdat). These wrappers were made to let GameFreak refer to each individual GUI file as a member in an enum.

[TODO: write documentation on .lytdat format]

[TODO: make a list of all known GUI assets in XY and where they're located]
