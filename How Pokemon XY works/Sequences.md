# Sequences

Every section of the game that can be described as a sequence of camera manipulations and animations playing on 3D models is handled by special files with the .bseq extension. These files store a sequential list of commands that tell the game how to arrange everything together and run the sequence in question. These sequences are used for:

- Every pokemon move in battle
- The game's opening and ending
- Every Cutscene
- Some overworld events?

[TODO: investigate the format of .bseq files]

[TODO: make a list of all Sequence related GARCs]

[TODO: make lists mapping sequence files in XY to what they're used for]
