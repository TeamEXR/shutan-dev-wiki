# Graphics pipeline

Generation 6 games use both nw::gfx and nw::h3d rendering pipelines from NintendoWare4CTR engine. Most high quality models are H3D models stored as BCH (Binary CTR Container) files, while lower quality models and some camera models are stored as CtrGFX (.bcmdl) files.

> Pokemon XY uses BCH v7 while Pokemon ORAS uses BCH v33

[TODO: add a full list of pokemon model/texture numbers here]

[TODO: categorize all 3D assets in XY between H3D and CtrGFX types]
