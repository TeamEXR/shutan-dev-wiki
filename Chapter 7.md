# Chapter 7: Stack vs Heap

Programs use two ways to store data in memory:

1. Allocate random parts of memory to storing data, and store the data there. This forms a **Heap** of data that the program can manipulate any way it wants.

2. Stack the data on top of each other, forming a **Stack** in memory.

Stacks are used for storing function parameters and local variables while Heaps are used for anything that doesn't have a fixed size and needs dynamic allocation (such as arrays and linked lists), they sometimes also store global variables.

That's it, that's the chapter. Let's move on

(TODO: include a diagram showing how stacks work)
