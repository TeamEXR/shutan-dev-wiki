# Chapter 7: Stack vs Heap

Programs use two ways to store data in RAM memory:

1. Put the data randomly around in an area, forming a **Heap** that can be cleaned up or added to whenever

2. Stack the data on top of each other, forming a **Stack** in memory.

Stacks are used for storing function parameters and local variables while Heaps are used for anything that doesn't have a fixed size and needs dynamic allocation (such as arrays and linked lists), they sometimes also store global variables.

That's it, that's the chapter. Let's move on

(TODO: include a diagram showing how stacks work)
