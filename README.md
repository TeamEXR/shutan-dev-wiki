# Project Shutan's developer wiki
This github repo hosts all the information we know about Pokemon Gen 6 (XY/ORAS) as well as a WIP guide to reverse engineering and general information about how 3DS games are structured

Note that this wiki is a work in progress and things might change between commits a lot. Any contribution is appreciated!
