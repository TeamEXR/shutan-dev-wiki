# Chapter 2: Electronic calculators

Calculation and arithmetic is a task that most humans (outside of math nerds) have always wanted to offload throughout history, mostly because taking a lot of time crunching numbers in your head is boring, error-prone, and takes way too long if you're aiming for Accuracy.

Many mechanical devices were made over the years to help with arithmetic, from the Abacus[1] to mechanical calculators[2], and even the difference engine[3]. But things changed when electricity entered the scene. Travelling at the speed of light meant that electrical calculators could become so powerful they'd be able to crunch out numbers near-instantly. And the components used in electrical machines were often much smaller and cheaper than the mechanical equivalents. The only issue was how to design Calculators to work with electricty.

You need to somehow assign numbers to levels of electricity to make an Electronic Calculator. The simplest way to do this is to assign 1 to the presence of high electricity[4], and 0 to the absence of electricity. This lets us make cheap electronic processors that are as small as possible without worrying without the limits of electrical engineering getting in the way and disrupting our operations[5]. 

But how can calculators designed to work with 0s and 1s handle all of our insane math operations? The answer is Boolean Algebra and Base 2 numbers. Let's dive into each a bit more.
