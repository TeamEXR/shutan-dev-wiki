# All you need to know before reverse engineering software

Reverse Engineering (RE for short in this guide) is the art of taking something completely unknown, pulling it apart, documenting how each part works and how they form a whole together.

Knowledge in Software Reverse Engineering (SRE for short in this guide) is pretty powerful because it means one can document the insides of most known computer programs and modify them as they want. In Shutan's case this allows us to fully understand the inner workings of Pokemon XY, thus enabling us to make better romhacks.

This more general guide is aimed at Programmers, aiming to explain concepts like machine code, assembly, compilation and linking, dynamic loading, etc. Just enough needed before you can jump into the nitty gritty of 3DS Reverse Engineering!
