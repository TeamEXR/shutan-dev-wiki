# NintendoWare and NintendoWare4CTR
Starting with the Wii, Nintendo offers a collection of useful frameworks and libraries to help developers make their games faster. These frameworks often add support for GUIs, better SFX/Song types, and a graphic pipeline optimized for the console.

For the Nintendo 3DS console, Nintendo and HAL Laboratories worked together NintendoWare4CTR, also known as NW4C.
NW4C offers a bunch of libraries:

- nw::lyt1 : older framework for GUI
- nw::lyt2 : newer framework for GUI (based on NintendoWare4Cafe, the framework for Wii U)
- nw::snd : framework for playing different types of sounds or music
- nw::eft : framework for rendering visual effects (VFX)
- nw::gfx : older framework for rendering models and playing animations
- nw::h3d : newer framework for rendering models and playing animations
