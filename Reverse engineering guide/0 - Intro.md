# Introduction

Reverse Engineering (RE for short in this guide) is the art of taking something completely unknown, pulling it apart, documenting how each part works and how they form a whole together.

Being able to reverse engineer software is pretty powerful because it means one can document the insides of most known computer programs and modify them as they want. In Shutan's case this allows us to fully understand the inner workings of Pokemon XY, thus enabling us to make better romhacks.

This guide gives a brief overview of what computers are made of and how they work, giving the reader essential knowledge they need before really delving into the nitty gritty of 3DS Reverse Engineering.
