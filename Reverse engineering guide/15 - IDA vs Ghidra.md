# IDA and Ghidra: Reverse Engineering Suites

The two most popular apps for reverse engineering binaries are IDA (**I**nteractive **D**is**A**ssembler) and Ghidra. Both are primarily aimed at malware RE but also have the tooling to support other kinds of reverse engineering.

These suits consist of a disassembler, a debugger, and decompilers, There's often additional functionality included to help with reverse engineering, especially when it comes to compiled C code.

Both tools are considered Industry Standard (Ghidra was originally an in-house NSA tool) however IDA is closed source and costs quite a bit for the full package while Ghidra is open source and completely free.

[TODO: Include a full comparison chart of both apps]

[TODO: Add links for books that help people learn how to use IDA or Ghidra]
